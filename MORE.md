# About
I am fascinated by complex systems, machine learning, and intuitive design.

## Job
At work, I apply machine learning solutions to mission-critical questions for my clients. These days, I am learning about CI/CD with Docker and Jenkins, creating mission-focused state-of-the-art NLP applications for clients, and learning how to write better software tests with tools like [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In the past, I've focused more on using deep learning to solve hard digital signals processing & computer vision problems, such as RF fingerprinting and video super-resolution.  

## Projects
I don't treat projects like a professional portfolio -- They're an outlet for my curiosity and an excuse to learn to use exciting tools. That being said, I have a few long-running projects.
* See my data projects on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elias.jaffe), such as the [vis with the interactive network graph](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elias.jaffe/viz/FlorentineFamilies/FlorentineFamiliesDash), and [filterable tables of plant species by state](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elias.jaffe/viz/PlantSpeciesTaxonomyByUSState/StateSpeciesDashboard).
* I own two twitter bots, both currently inactive while I attempt to refine their internals and host them on dedicated Raspberry Pis. [GestaltLogos](https://twitter.com/GestaltLogos) is a project about refining political discourse into generic talking points. My big-picture goal is NLP-aided rhetorical analysis, but I am stuck on some of the finer details. For example, I am currently working on creating a dataset of examples that distinguish between talking point similarity VS topical similarity regarding legislative tweets. I promised twitter I wouldn't share/rehost the tweets, so it cannot be found here :( . I have also experimented with word embeddings and "distance" "metrics" for these tweets, results which I can (and intend to) publish on Medium soon.
* My other (currently inactive) twitter bot is [What Do I Tweet Bot](https://twitter.com/WhatDoITweetBot), which performs analysis of a user's own twitter content, including topic modeling and pattern of life analysis. I am currently building new skills for the bot (such as textual entailment) and improving the underlying [code](https://github.com/Ejjaffe/nlp-bot) so that it can run in a (relatively) asynchronous and robust manner. It used to run on my laptop and I am in the process of hosting it on a dedicated raspberry pi.
* I have built several [streamlit dashboards](https://github.com/Ejjaffe/mT5-summarization-app), some of which inspired real NLP R&D projects at work.
* I love working with open-source hardware and microelectronics! I have a tutorial on [how to create a functional motion-alert webcam](https://medium.com/@elijaffe173/guide-to-installing-and-using-motioneyeos-on-a-raspberry-pi-zero-w-from-scratch-9fa08d3146af) using roughly $50 worth of equipment. In the past, I've used ESP32 boards as habit tracker buttons and created roaming robots using one arduino uno and a Q-learning algorithm.

Other projects usually end up on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/eliasjjaffe) if they look interesting!

## Education
I have a bachelor's degree in mathematics from a small liberal arts college, McDaniel College in Westminster, MD. I liked the liberal arts environment because it allowed me to make connections between mathematics and other things I love, such as ceramics, music, writing, and political analysis. Some cool things I did:
* I was a summer research fellow. I worked on a problem in fractal geometry, the mathematics of of measuring shapes with infinite detail. We presented our research on the fractal dimension of the [k-nacci word fractal](https://github.com/Ejjaffe/Knacci-Utils) many times, including at MAA's Mathfest 2016 and many McDaniel College research showcase events.
* I was accepted as a National Security Scholarship recipient, which was a combination internship and scholarship, sponsored by the NSA & MICUA. At the internship, I used machine learning to give new functionality to a flagship antenna array.
* I [won the 2019 MAGIC Hackathon](https://magicinc.org/winners-of-the-2019-carroll-county-hackathon) in Westminster with my best friend and a few strangers. In 48 hours, we built a patient-centered android app that communicates sensitive medical data between electronic medical records systems in a HIPAA-compliant way, along with a buisness model and branding. [MAGIC](https://magicinc.org/) encouraged us to take it further, and I pitched the app and concept at the [BlueCross BlueShield Healthcare Innovation Challenge](https://www.bcbs.com/bluecross-blueshield-data-innovation-challenge), where we made it to the second-to-last round, placing at the top 10 out of around 130 startups. It was a really cool experience and I appreciate MAGIC's mission. I have volunteered as a mentor and judge at every MAGIC hackathon since.
